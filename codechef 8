Problem
Mario was going to gift Princess Peach a string 
�
S of even length 
�
N.

Mario was clumsy and thus, broke the string in the middle. He now has two strings 
�
A and 
�
B such that 
�
=
�
[
1
,
�
2
]
A=S[1, 
2
N
​
 ] and 
�
=
�
[
�
2
+
1
,
�
]
B=S[ 
2
N
​
 +1,N].

Mario is not sure about the order in which he should join the strings 
�
A and 
�
B to get the string 
�
S. Thus, he joins the strings in any random order. Find whether it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string 
�
S if he joins the strings 
�
A and 
�
B in any order.

Note that 
�
[
�
,
�
]
S[L,R] denotes a substring of string 
�
S starting at index 
�
L and having a length 
(
�
−
�
+
1
)
(R−L+1).

	    string str2=s.substr(n/2,n);

	    }
	    cout<<str1<<endl;
	    cout<<str2<<endl;
	    cout<<s<<endl;

	return 0;
